# PROJECT_STATE

Living status file. Update it when something material changes.

## 2026-09-02 -- bootstrap

- Fresh repo created at `C:\Users\you\Downloads\scratch-repo\webapps`
  (separate from the frozen `story-app` repo).
- Subagent definitions written: `builder`, `researcher`, `deployer`.
  Frontmatter format (`isolation: worktree`, comma-form `tools:`,
  `model:`) confirmed valid against current Claude Code docs.
- Hosting stack **code** written (`hosting/`): one private S3 bucket
  (OAC, versioned, RETAIN), one CloudFront distribution (URI-rewrite
  function for path prefixes, 403->404), optional account-wide $10
  budget. Landing page + 404 in `hosting/site-root/`.
- Tier 2 template copied to `reference/` from story-app.

## 2026-09-02 -- hosting stack deployed

`WebappsHostingStack` CREATE_COMPLETE in `<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>` / `us-east-1`.
Landing page live at https://<DISTRIBUTION_DOMAIN>/

- BucketName: `<APPS_BUCKET>`
- DistributionId: `<DISTRIBUTION_ID>`
- DistributionDomain: `<DISTRIBUTION_DOMAIN>`

Also mirrored (gitignored) in `hosting/.hosting-outputs.env`, which
`scripts/deploy-app.ps1` reads.

## Not done yet

- **Credential envelope -- confirm.** DEPLOY.md step 0 (rename
  `[default]` -> `[story-deploy]`) needs to be verified done: open a
  fresh PowerShell with `AWS_PROFILE` unset and check
  `aws sts get-caller-identity` fails. That's the environment
  `Bash`-capable subagents run in.
- **No app built.** `apps/` has only `_shared/`. The house style
  (`apps/_shared/style.css` + `preview.html`) is in place.
- **`site-root/` sync -- confirm.** If the hosting deploy was run by
  hand rather than via `scripts/deploy-hosting.ps1`, the landing page +
  404 may not be on the bucket yet. Check the URL above; if it 403s,
  run the sync from DEPLOY.md step 1.
- **Budget alarm** only exists if `-c alert_email=...` was passed.

## Known machine gotchas (from docs/SYSTEM_PLAN_NOTES.md §6)

- `aws` not on PATH -> `C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLIV2\aws.exe`.
- Run `aws`/`cdk` from PowerShell, not Git Bash.
- CDK needs the venv python first on PATH; system Python 3.10 lacks
  `aws-cdk-lib`.
- `JSII_SILENCE_WARNING_UNTESTED_NODE_VERSION=1` (Node 26).
- Account <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID> / us-east-1 already CDK-bootstrapped.
